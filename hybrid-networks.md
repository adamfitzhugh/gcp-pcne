##Â Hybrid Networks

### Hybrid Connections
    - VPN, Interconnects & Cloud Routers
    - LOA-CFA is sent by Google to us on-premises which we forward onto our colocation facility to provision cross connects between GCP and us on-premises
    - Dedicated Interconnect - where our colocation facility provider provisions a circuit between our network and GCP
    - Partner Interconnect - used if we do not want minimum 10Gbps speed of a dedicated interconnect OR if our on-premises DC cannot reach a dedicated interconnect colocation facility
    - VPN securely connects our network to GCP network over IPSec VPN tunnel
    - Direct Peering is used to connect on-premises network directly to GCP Edge Network
    - Carrier Peering works exactly the same way as direct peering except we use a shared network from our service provider to access GCP. We would use carrier peering if we didn't need full 10Gbps speeds to GCP

### Dedicated Interconnect
    - Provides physical connection between our on-premises network and our GCP VPC network (direct to VPC)
    - Supports only dynamic routing
    - Supports minimum 10Gbps & up to 200Gbps
    - Select a metropolitan area closest to our on-premises network and establish a connection to GCP
    - On the LOA-CFA form, we specify what speeds/connections we need. We can ask for up to 8 10Gbps connections or 2 100Gbps connections
    - Recommended to create secondary interconnect link for redundancy purposes
    - Once setup we create a BGP peering between on-premises network and the cloud router within our VPC
    - You can add vLAN attachments to already existing dedicated interconnects
    - You can choose different bandwidths per vLAN attachment across the interconnect. Maximum speed is 50Gbps

### Partner Interconnect
    - Partner interconnects are used if our on-premises DC cannot reach a dedicated interconnect colocation facility OR if we do not need 10Gbps
    - Most connections are layer 3, but some offer layer 2 connections
    - When we create a vLAN attachment for a partner interconnect, GCP creates a pairing key that we provide to our service provider in order to connect the service provider connection to our VPC network. The key can only be used once!
    - No need for an LOA-CFA
    - The region you select for the vLAN attachment must be supported by a partner interconnect location which is a city where the service providers network meets Googles network
    - Connection capacity can range from 50Mbps to 10Gbps

### Cloud VPN
    - Securely extends GCP network through IPSec VPN tunnel
    - 2 VPN options - HA VPN & Classic VPN
    - Routing options include BGP, Route based or Policy based
    - You can advertise Cloud router advertisements or select custom routes to advertise
    - In HA VPN dynamic mode, a cloud router is mandatory
    - HA VPN interfaces are created regionally
    - Cloud VPN supports 3Gbps maximum transfer rate per VPN tunnel & an MTU of 1460. MTU can be adjusted
    - Cloud VPN supports IKEv1 & IKEv2
    - Routing traffic between 2 on-premises sites through GCP (like a transit) is not allowed
    - If the MED for 2 VPN tunnels is the same, GCP will use ECMP to balance traffic across both links
    - GCP recommends active/passive routing on HA VPN, because if a link fails on an active/active set up, it can cause some issues in terms of available bandwidth
    - Classic VPN offers 99.9% uptime
